      <h2>Web Accessibility</h2>
          <p>To design and code websites in the way that people with disabilities can use them, 
            is one of the main goals when making a website accessible.</p>
          
          <p>We had accessibility in mind from the start, and considered this when choosing 
            the layout and color-scheme for our website.
            We kept the layout clear, with easy navigation of the website. You can also easily navigate 
            the website by using only the Tab and Enter keys, which is a very important aspect of web accessibility.</p>

          <p>We included the main page regions to our website, such as header, navigation, main content and footer, so 
            that it would be easier for web browsers to identify them.</p>

          <p>We chose a readable font size (16px is recommended) and fonts that are easibly readable.</p>  

          <p>Text alternatives were provided to all none text content (images).</p>

      <h2>Testing Our Code</h2>
          <p>After checking our code at html and css code validators, we found a few mistakes regarding not closed tags. 
            It was an easy task to fix and after that our code looked even more tidy. </p>  

          <p>Web Accessibility Checker showed a mistake regarding social media buttons. To fix it, we had to give a description
            of what the buttons were about, by adding the class in h. Also, we were missing skip to content tool, 
            that makes it easier for those that might relay only on keybord using to navigate the site. To make it work, we had to 
            make some changes in html and css code. Moreover, we got a few possible mistakes regarding images and their descriptions.</p>  

          <p>To make website more accessible, we checked our website color choices at 
          Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. Since the ratio was high enough, we went with light color-scheme with high contrasts.</p>
